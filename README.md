# Event Management Website
MAIN OBJECTIVE:

To facilitate the user with select, update,delete and insert operations using html frontend and MySQL backend.

DESCRIPTION:

NEED FOR PHP MYSQL CONNECTIVITY: 

PHP being the server side programming language and MYSQL an open source relational database management system when combined together is capable of delivering highly unique solutions. 

One of the main reasons businesses choose PHP MYSQL Application Development is its simplicity and ease of use.

PHP is a server side programming language that handles HTTP requests... In my php script I have connected it to a sql database so that we use the information from it.

ONLINE EVENT REGISTRATION:

I have made a webpage for online gaming event registration using php mysql connectivity, users can register for the upcoming event, they can update previously registered information supported by security features(OTP verification).

Users can cancel their registration at anytime and also view the list of participants for the event.

While displaying the participants list, we will not disclose any credentials like phone number with which other users can manipulate the current userâ€™s information.

We have also implemented dynamic information display on the homepage which displays the number of participants in each game category which will be updated automatically.

This statistical data is updated for each entry/updation/cancelation in the main database.

Other information like prize money and payment methods are displayed on the homepage too.
